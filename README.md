# python_samplecodes
Some Sample code that I worked on during Edx course.
These sample code bases will help you understand some of the concepts that I have learned during the course and 
same logic can be used any where it is required. 

Please feel free to edit any script if you feel that it can be preform better or is there any good way that we can do it.
As these are my first scripts I have written in Python there is possiblity that I didn't write them to perfection.
